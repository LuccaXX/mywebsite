        <h1>Equilibrium</h1>
        <img src="/3.jpg">
        <p>Yin Yang is a fundamental concept in Chinese philosophy and 
            the Tao religion. It represents the idea that opposite 
            forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural 
            world. </p>
        
        <p>These forces are not in conflict but rather complement each 
            other, creating balance and harmony. Inspired by the 
            well-known Yin Yang symbol, I wanted to represent these 
            principles using ink and water. The black ink bleeds into 
            the white and vice versa, indicating that within each force, 
            there is always a hint of the other.</p>
        
        <p>
            
            Inspired by the contrast between desert and tundra, the 
            second installation portrays how this  concept of Yin and 
            Yang is deeply reflected in *Game of Thrones.Between Jon 
            Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Their characters, though 
            seemingly opposite, share an intrinsic connection—one that 
            mirrors the idea of balance and interdependence.</p>
        <p>
            Jon Snow embodies the cold, the night, the passive and steady
            force. Raised in the icy North, he is introspective, guided 
            by duty, and often reluctant to seek power. Like Yin, which 
            is receptive and grounding, Jon is a stabilizing force, 
            enduring hardships and making sacrifices for the greater 
            good. 
            </p>
            <p>
            His leadership is defined by humility, restraint, and 
            an unwavering sense of honor. Daenerys Targaryen, on the other 
            hand, represents Yang—the fire, the sun, the active and 
            dynamic force. Born in exile, she is driven by passion, ambition, 
            and an unyielding desire for change. Like Yang, which is 
            assertive and commanding, Daenerys is a force of movement and 
            transformation, igniting revolutions and reshaping the world in 
            her vision. Her leadership is fueled by vision, charisma, and an 
            almost divine sense of destiny.
            Yet, despite their stark differences, Jon and Daenerys are not 
            purely Yin or Yang. Jon, though a man of ice, carries fire 
            within him in his moments of fierce leadership. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Daenerys, though a woman of fire, holds ice in her heart. A vulnerability 
            that mirrors Jon’s own struggles. Their personalities blend into 
            each other. I wanted to portray that this interplay is not only 
            seen between the characters but within a single individual as 
            well. Every person holds both forces within them—moments of 
            uiet reflection and moments of bold action, kindness and 
            ruthlessness, restraint and impulse. 
            </p>
             <p>
            True balance comes from embracing both sides rather than rejecting one in favour of the 
            other. You would be incomplete without one or the other, harmony
            exists in embracing both.</p>

                The above quotes come from the Tao Te Ching which can be 
                translated as The Book of the Immanence of the Way or 
                The Book of the Way and How It Manifests itself in the 
                World or simply The Book of the Way. Inspired by these 
                quotes, the final installation is a text composition 
                that emphasises the idea that true fulfilment comes 
                from embracing seeming contradictions. </p>
